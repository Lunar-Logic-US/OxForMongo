OxForMongo
==========

This framework is designed to be flexible, quick, and scalable, just like MongoDB. Ox for MongoDB leverages the strengths of PHP and MongoDB. We intended to avoid implementing superfluous features as much as possible, in favor of the concept that you the programmer want ultimate control over how your application works.
