<h2>Quick Start Hints</h2>

<h3>Changing this home page.</h3>
<p>This home page is a simple HTML file that is located in
    app-blank/constructs/root/index.html.  Setting up quick html
    files is useful for quick wire framing of sites.

<h3>Example Assembly Construct</h3>
<p>This home page is a simple HTML file that is located in
    app-blank/constructs/root/index.html.  Setting up quick html
    files is useful for quick wire framing of sites.
</p>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<h3>Constructs</h3>
<p>The basic idea of the framework is to group together code that works together to build a
    programming or user-interface construct.  An example of a construct might be a web page that displays a blog entry with
    all of the ajax support to add comments.  Another might me a CRUD page for some database information.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>An action controls what needed for your construct.  It could be as simple as the Ox_FlatAction with displays a simple
    HTML file like this one. Another example is the Ox_AssetAction with help save and retrieve files on the server.  The
    built in action that you will use for most dynamic pages will be the Ox_AssemblerAction.</p>
